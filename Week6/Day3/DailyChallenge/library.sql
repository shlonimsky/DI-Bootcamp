-- Daily Challenge: Tables Relationships
-- Part I
-- Create 2 tables : Customer and Customer profile. They have a One to One relationship.
-- A customer can have only one profile, and a profile belongs to only one customer
-- The Customer table should have the columns : id, first_name, last_name NOT NULL
-- The Customer profile table should have the columns : id, isLoggedIn DEFAULT false (a Boolean), customer_id (a reference to the 
-- Customer table)
CREATE TABLE customer(
	customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE customer_profile(
	profile_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	isLoggedIn BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
	customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customer(customer_id)ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

-- Insert those customers John Doe, Jerome Lalu, Lea Rive
INSERT INTO customer (first_name,last_name)
VALUES ('John','Doe'),('Jerome','Lalu'),('Lea','Rive')
RETURNING *;

-- Insert those customer profiles, use subqueries: John is loggedIn, Jerome is not logged in
INSERT INTO customer_profile (isLoggedIn,customer_id)
VALUES (
	'true', (SELECT customer_id FROM customer WHERE first_name='John')
),(
	false, (SELECT customer_id FROM customer WHERE first_name='Jerome')
)
RETURNING *;

-- Use the relevant types of Joins to display:
-- The first_name of the LoggedIn customers
SELECT first_name FROM customer
JOIN customer_profile ON customer_profile.customer_id=customer.customer_id
WHERE isLoggedIn;
-- All the customers first_name and isLoggedIn columns - even the customers those who donâ€™t have a profile.
SELECT first_name,isLoggedIn FROM customer
LEFT JOIN customer_profile ON customer_profile.customer_id=customer.customer_id
-- The number of customers that are not LoggedIn
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer
-- LEFT JOIN customer_profile ON customer_profile.customer_id=customer.customer_id
WHERE isLoggedIn=FALSE;

-- Part II:
-- Create a table named Book, with the columns : book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title NOT NULL, author NOT NULL
CREATE TABLE book(
	book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
	author VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
)

-- Insert those books :
-- Alice In Wonderland, Lewis Carroll
-- Harry Potter, J.K Rowling
-- To kill a mockingbird, Harper Lee
INSERT INTO book (title,author)
VALUES ('Alice In Wonderland', 'Lewis Carroll'),('Harry Potter', 'J.K Rowling'),('To kill a mockingbird', 'Harper Lee')
RETURNING*

-- Create a table named Student, with the columns : student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name NOT NULL UNIQUE, age. Make sure that the age is never bigger than 15 (Find an SQL method);
CREATE TABLE Student(
	student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	age SMALLINT CHECK(age>0 AND age<=15)
)

-- Insert those students:
-- John, 12
-- Lera, 11
-- Patrick, 10
-- Bob, 14
INSERT INTO Student (name,age)
VALUES ('John',12),('Lera',11),('Patrick',10),('Bob',14)
returning *;

-- Create a table named Library, with the columns :
-- book_fk_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
-- student_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
-- borrowed_date
-- This table, is a junction table for a Many to Many relationship with the Book and Student tables : 
-- A student can borrow many books, and a book can be borrowed by many children
-- book_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column book_id from the Book table
-- student_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column student_id from the Student table
-- The pair of Foreign Keys is the Primary Key of the Junction Table
CREATE TABLE Library(
	book_id INTEGER REFERENCES book (book_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
	student_id INTEGER REFERENCES student (student_id)ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
	borrowed_date DATE DEFAULT NOW(),
	PRIMARY KEY (book_id,student_id)
);

-- Add 4 records in the junction table, use subqueries.
-- the student named John, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 15/02/2022
-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book To kill a mockingbird on the 03/03/2021
-- the student named Lera, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 23/05/2021
-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book Harry Potter the on 12/08/2021
