# Review on Javascript

#### Basics

1. How to access the second element of the array `const nums = [3, 7, 10]`

2. For the code below, what does `arrNums.splice(2, 0)` return?

    ```javascript
    const arrNums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    ```

3. What is the result of the following code :

    ```javascript
    const bestNumbers = [1, 2, 3]
    const secondBestNumbers = [7, 8, 9]
    
    const favoriteNumbers = [4, 5, 6, ...bestNumbers, ...secondBestNumbers];
    console.log(favoriteNumbers)
    ```

4. What does the following code print to the console?

   ```javascript
   const football = {
     type: "sport",
     clubs: {
       france : "Paris Saint-Germain",
       spain : "Atlético Madrid",
     }
   }  
   
   football.clubs.spain = "Real Madrid";
   console.log(football.clubs.spain);
   ```
   
   
5. What does the following code print to the console?

   ```javascript
   const myteam = "bestTeam";
   
   const football = {
     type: "sport",
     clubs: {
       france : "Paris Saint-Germain",
       spain : "Atlético Madrid",
     }
   }  
   
   football.clubs[myteam] = "France national football team";
   console.log(football.clubs);
   ```   
   
6. Can we define the function as follows? 
    If yes, 
    * what is it called ?
    * what is this part ?
        ```
        function(a, b){
           return a*b;
        }
        ```
    * explain how to invoke it

    ```javascript
    const x = function(a, b){
       return a*b;
    }
    ```

7. Variables created **without** any keyword, are always global, even if they are created inside a function ? Yes or No and explain

    ```javascript
    function x() {
    	a = 5;
    }
    ```

#### Functions

8. In JavaScript can we pass functions as arguments to other functions? What does this code return ?

    ```javascript
    function sayHello() {
       return "Hello, ";
    }
    function greeting(helloMessage, name) {
      console.log(helloMessage() + name);
    }
    greeting(sayHello, "JavaScript!");
    ```
    
9. Transform this function into an arrow function. Explain what is the goal of this parameter `num1=10`.

      ```javascript
      function sum(num1=10, num2){
          return num1 + num2
      }
      
      sum(40,2)
      sum(42,0)
      console.log("the answer to everything is", sum(42,0))
      ```

10. How would you call the `foo` function in the console.log, in order to display what the `bar` function returns ? Explain the process and concept behind it

     ```javascript
     function foo () {
       function bar() {
         return "Poppin' bottles";
       }
       return bar;
     }
     
     console.log(?)
     ```

#### DOM

11. Which of the following events will you add in the `addEventListener()`method? 
      ☐ click
      ☐ onclick

12. Does the `addEventListener()` method allow you to add many events to the same element?

    ```javascript
    x.addEventListener("mouseover", func1);
    x.addEventListener("click", func2);
    x.addEventListener("mouseout", func3);`
    ```

13. DOM exercise

      1. Part I : Create a button in your HTML page, when the user will click the the button a paragraph will be added on the DOM.
                * If the number of paragraph added is a multiple of 3, the content of the paragraph is "Hello"
                * else the content of the paragraph is "New Paragraph" --> MANDATORY  : use ternary operator
                    * Example: if the paragraph is the 3rd one added, the content should be "Hello"
        --> MANDATORY : Use arrow functions.

      2. Part II : Add to each new paragraph, an event listener of mouse over. When you hover on a paragraph, the paragraph should become red (ie. color of the                        text).

#### Array Methods : forEach, map, filter, reduce, find, every, some

14. Do this exercise twice: first with a `for loop`, then with a `for of loop`.
Console.log the sum of this array

    ```javascript
       const marks = [67, 60, 89, 90, 67, 42];
    ```

15. What is the value of `passed` in the following code?

     ```javascript
         const marks = [67, 60, 89, 90, 67, 42];

         const passed = marks.every(function(m) {
            return m >= 50;
         });
     ```

16. What does the following code log?

    ```javascript
       const nums = [10, 50, 88];

       const bignums = nums.filter(function(n) {
          return n > 10;
       });

       console.log(bignums);
    ```

17. Use a **javascript array method** to square the value of every element in the array. 

    ```javascript
       const input = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
       //code
       console.log(input) // [ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
    ```

18. Use **2 javascript array methods** and chain them to return the sum of all the positives ones. 

     ```javascript
         const secondInput = [ 1, -4, 12, 0, -3, 29, -150];
         //code
         console.log(total) //42
     ```

19. Use **3 javascript methods** and chain them to abbreviate the name and return the name initials.

     ```javascript
         const input = 'George Raymond Richard Martin';
         //code 
         console.log(initials)//'GRRM'
     ```

#### Object and Classes

20. How objects are passed to a function in JavaScript? By Value or By Reference ? Explain in detail, using the below example:

    ```javascript
    function changeTshirt (myshirt){
        console.log("myshirt", myshirt);
        myshirt.color = "red"
        console.log("myshirt", myshirt); //this is the parameter
        console.log("tshirt", tshirt);   //this is the global variable
    }


    const tshirt = {
        color : "blue",
        price : 10
    }

    changeTshirt(tshirt)
    ```

21. How would you change the code above, so that when you modify the key `color` from the parameter `myshirt`, it won't change the global variable `tshirt` ?

22. Use object destructuring to retrieve the value of the keys `france` and `spain`

    ```javascript
     const football = {
         type: "sport",
         clubs: {
           france : "Paris Saint-Germain",
           spain : "Atlético Madrid",
         }
       }  
    ```

23. Use object destructuring in the function to retrieve the value of the keys `france` and `spain`

    ```javascript
     function retrieveSports (//here) {
        const sentence = `My favorite football teams are ${franceTeam} and ${spainTeam}`;
        console.log(sentence);
     }

     const football = {
         type: "sport",
         clubs: {
           france : "Paris Saint-Germain",
           spain : "Atlético Madrid",
         }
       }  

     retrieveSports(football)
    ```

24. What will be printed in the console

    ```javascript
    class Item {
       constructor(nameProduct, priceProduct) { 
             this.name = nameProduct;
             this.price = priceProduct;
       }

       displayInfo () {
            console.log(this.name + " is for $ " + this.price)
       }
    } 

    const cake = new Item("Chocolate Cake", 10);
    cake.displayInfo();
    ```

#### Promises

25. What will be the output and why ? What will be the state of the promise ?

    ```javascript
    Promise.resolve('Success!')
      .then(data => {
        return data.toUpperCase()
      })
      .then(data => {
        console.log(data)
      })
    ```

26. What will be displayed by the following code, after 2 seconds?

    ```javascript
    const p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
       setTimeout(function() {
          resolve("OK");
       }, 2000);
    });
    
    p.then(function(data) {
       console.log(data);
    });
    ```

27. Consider the following `async` function and its output. What will be displayed to the console when calling the `test()` function? Explain the process

    ```javascript
    async function test() {
      let result = 'first!';
      
      const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve('done!'), 1000);
      });
    
      result = await promise;
    
      console.log(result);
    }
    
    test();
    ```

28. Use **async await**, and **the fetch API** to fetch a fact on cats and display it. Use this third party API :  `https://catfact.ninja/fact`
    1. In the HTML file, create a button, everytime you click it you will add a random cat fact on the DOM 
    2. In the JS file, create 2 functions : one to fetch data from API, the other one to display it on the page using the DOM
    3. Make sure to use try and catch

29. Use **async await**, and **the fetch API** to POST some data.
    * Retrieve the data from a form (you can use new FormData), and send this data to this API : `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`. 
    * The server will send you back some dummy data that you will display on the DOM.
    * Use the documentation of the API : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/
    * Use the fetch API documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#uploading_json_data
    * Use the new FormData documentation with Object.fromEntries() : https://gomakethings.com/the-object.fromentries-method-in-vanilla-js/


#### BONUS : Classes

Welcome to the space station! It is your first day onboard and as the newest and most junior member of the crew, you have been asked to organize the library of manuals and fun novels for the crew to read.

Headquarters have asked that you store the following information about each book.

* The title
* The author
* Creation date
* The number of pages
* The number of times the book has been read.
* If the book was thrown away (boolean)

Headquarters also needs you to track certain actions that you must perform when books get out of date. 
* First, *a book* can be read, everytime this method is called, the number of times the book was read is inscreased by 1
* First, *for a manual*, the book must be thrown out if it is over 5 years old. 
* Second, *for a novel*, the book should be thrown out if it has been checked out over 100 times.

1. Construct three classes that hold the information needed by headquarters as properties. 
* One class should be a Book class 
* and two child classes of the Book class called Manual and Novel. 
* Each class will contain two methods. 
    * One will be a constructor. 
    * The other one will either be in charge of disposal of the book or updating the property related to the number of times a book has been checked out. 

Hint: This means you need to read through the requirements for the problem and decide what should belong to Book and what should belong to the Novel and Manual classes.

2. Declare an object of the `Novel` class for the following tome from the library:

| VARIABLE                                      | VALUE                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Title                                         | Top Secret Shuttle Building Manual |
| Author                                        | Redacted                           |
| Creation date                                 | 2013                               |
| Number of pages                               | 1147                               |
| Number of times the book was read             | 1                                  |
| If the book was thrown away                   | No                                 |

<br>

3. Declare an object of the Manual class for the following tome from the library:

<br>

| VARIABLE                                      | VALUE               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Title                                         | Pride and Prejudice |
| Author                                        | Jane Austen         |
| Creation date                                 | 1813                |
| Number of pages                               | 432                 |
| Number of times the book was read             | 32                  |
| If the book was thrown away                   | No                  |

<br>

4. One of the above books needs to be discarded. Call the appropriate method for that book to update the property. That way the crew can throw it into empty space to become debris.

5. The other book has been checked out 5 times since you first created the object. Call the appropriate method to update the number of times the book has been checked out.
