// Instructions
// Create a public folder, that contains an HTML file. This HTML file can contain some CSS and some JavaScript (for example a head tag with some classes for styling, and in the body a button with an onClick attribute calling a Javascript function with an alert)
// In a server.js file create your server using express.
// Use your server to get the static HTML file from the public folder
// Your server should run on http://localhost:3000/ to serve the HTML file
const express = require('express')
const app =express();
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server is listening'))
app.use('/',express.static('./public'))
